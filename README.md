## 🎧 Music Recommendation System Using Spotify Dataset

###  Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Music Recommendation System** using the **Spotify Tracks Dataset**, which contains audio features and metadata for thousands of songs across multiple genres. The recommendation engine leverages **content-based filtering** techniques using acoustic features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and valence to suggest similar songs to the user.

Music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music rely on such systems to enhance user experience and engagement. By understanding the underlying features that define the "feel" of a song, we can recommend new tracks that closely match a listener's preferences.

###  Objectives

* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand song features and genre distribution.
* Build a **content-based recommender** that suggests similar tracks based on audio features.
* Experiment with **clustering** (e.g., K-Means) to group songs into mood/style-based categories.
* (Optional) Create a **Streamlit app** for interactive recommendations.

###  Dataset

* **Source**: [Ultimate Spotify Tracks Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks)
* **Attributes**:

  * Track Name
  * Artist Name
  * Genre
  * Release Year
  * Audio Features:

    * `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `tempo`, `liveness`, etc.

---

###  Techniques Used

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling duplicates, missing values, scaling numeric features.
* **Feature Engineering**: Using audio attributes as input vectors.
* **Similarity Computation**: Using **Cosine Similarity** to find songs with similar profiles.
* **Clustering** (Optional): Applying **K-Means** to group songs into musical "moods".
* **Visualization**: EDA with seaborn, matplotlib, PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* **(Optional)**: Front-end interface with **Streamlit** for user input and recommendations.

---

###  Outputs

* A list of similar tracks given a user-selected song.
* Optionally, cluster-based recommendations like “Upbeat songs” or “Relaxing music”.
* An interactive web app for trying out the recommendation engine.

---

###  Potential Extensions

* Add **collaborative filtering** if user preference or playlist data becomes available.
* Integrate **lyrics analysis** using NLP techniques.
* Train a **deep learning model** to recommend songs based on embeddings.
